# Contributing Guide

## 🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 Greetings!

Welcome to TextTools. We have a simple rule for our project: **keep it simple!**
As you can see, almost all utilities and functionalities in our project are minimal, clean, and efficient. For every feature, utility, etc. you add, please keep these points in mind.

## 📌 Coding Standards

### 1. Use proper type annotations
Make sure to use type annotations properly.

### 2. Use ruff code linter
To maintain a standard codebase with a consistent style, please use the ruff linter. Also, don't forget to organize imports using ruff.

### 3. Update docs for each change
When updating a feature, don't forget to update the documentation. This includes both docstrings and README.md.

### 4. Update examples when adding a tool
When adding a tool to the project, please don't forget to:
- Write code consistent with other tools
- Name your tool in the **do** form of a verb (like `categorize`)
- Write full docstrings for your tool
- Update the README.md tools list and the `Tool Quality Tiers` section
- Ensure everything is consistent with other tools
